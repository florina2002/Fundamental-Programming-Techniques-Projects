ðŸ“Œ Project 1: Polynomial Calculator

Overview
A graphical calculator for performing mathematical operations on polynomials. Users can input polynomials and execute operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, integration, and derivation.

Features
	â€¢	Built using Java Swing
	â€¢	Uses Map for polynomial representation
	â€¢	Operations: +, -, *, derivative, integral
	â€¢	Follows MVC architecture
	â€¢	Includes JUnit tests for logic verification

Technologies: Java, Swing, JUnit

ðŸ“‚ Packages:
	â€¢	model â€“ Polynomial data structures
	â€¢	logic â€“ Operation and Controller classes
	â€¢	gui â€“ Graphical user interface (View)

ðŸ“Œ Project 2: Queue Management System

Overview
A simulation of multiple queues, using multithreading and synchronization, where clients are generated randomly and assigned to queues in real-time based on wait time.

Features
	â€¢	Multithreaded simulation with synchronized queues
	â€¢	Real-time event logging and GUI
	â€¢	Strategy pattern for queue assignment
	â€¢	Performance metrics: average wait time, service time, peak hour
	â€¢	Uses Java Swing for the UI

Technologies: Java, Threads, Synchronization, Swing

ðŸ“‚ Key Components:
	â€¢	model â€“ Server and Task classes
	â€¢	business â€“ SimulationManager, Scheduler, Strategy logic
	â€¢	gui â€“ SimulationFrame for user interaction

ðŸ“Œ Project 3: Orders Management System

Overview
An application for managing clients, products, and orders, with full CRUD operations and persistent storage using an embedded relational database (SQLite).

Features
	â€¢	Layered architecture: model, dataAccessLayer, businessLayer, presentation
	â€¢	GUI with separate panels for managing clients, products, and orders
	â€¢	Reflection used to dynamically populate tables (JTable)
	â€¢	Immutable Bill class using Java Records
	â€¢	Generic DAO with reflection-based query generation
	â€¢	Input validation and error handling

Technologies: Java, Swing, SQLite, Reflection

ðŸ“‚ Architecture:
	â€¢	model â€“ Client, Product, Order, Bill
	â€¢	dataAccessLayer â€“ Generic and specific DAOs
	â€¢	businessLayer â€“ Core logic (validations, processing)
	â€¢	presentation â€“ GUI interfaces

â¸»

ðŸ“š Skills & Concepts Practiced
	â€¢	Java OOP & design principles
	â€¢	GUI development with Swing
	â€¢	Threads & concurrency
	â€¢	Strategy & DAO patterns
	â€¢	Reflection & dynamic table generation
